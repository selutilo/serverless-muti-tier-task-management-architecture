# Serverless Multi-Tier Task Management App

## What It Demonstrates
- Event-driven architecture
- Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)
- Security best practices
- Cost optimization patterns

## AWS Services 
- Frontend: `S3 + CloudFront`
- Backend: `API Gateway + Lambda (Python 3.12)`
- Database: `DynamoDB`
- Notifications: `SNS (email subscription optional)`
- Monitoring: `CloudWatch alarms`
- Security: `IAM least privilege`, `WAF (optional)`

## App Capabilities
- Create / read / update / delete tasks
- Generate pre-signed S3 upload URL for images
- Publish task event notifications via SNS

## Security Notes
- Frontend bucket is private and only readable via CloudFront OAC.
- Upload bucket blocks public access and is encrypted.
- Lambda role only allows required actions for DynamoDB, S3 uploads, SNS publish, logs.
- WAF can be enabled for CloudFront in higher environments.

## Cost Notes
- DynamoDB uses `PAY_PER_REQUEST`.
- Lambda/API are serverless (pay-per-use).
- CloudFront `PriceClass_100` keeps edge cost lower.
- Upload bucket lifecycle policy expires old objects after 90 days.
